A command-line tool that simplifies CSS testing by using [Cucumber](http://cukes.info/ "Cucumber - Making BDD") and makes it simple to include in your automated build process. There's also a [chrome extension](/chrome-extension.html) to simplify making test cases. It runs on [Node.JS](http://nodejs.org/ "node.js") and uses [Selenium](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/ "Selenium - Web Browser Automation").
