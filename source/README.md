Once you have Wintersmith installed, you can preview the site by navigating into this folder (`./source`) then running

The content of the pages is generated from the Markdown files in `./source/contents/`. To create the final static site, run

    wintersmith build

And the files will be generated then moved into the `./dist/` folder.
